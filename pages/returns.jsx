        <p>
          Unopened, unused products can be returned within 30 days of delivery for a full refund to your original
          payment method.
        </p>
      </PolicySection>

      <PolicySection title="Opened products">
        <p>
          Because our products are cosmetics applied to skin, opened or used items are final sale and can't be
          returned for hygiene reasons — unless the product arrived damaged or defective, in which case see below.

        <p>
          If your order arrives damaged or defective, email us at{' '}

          days of delivery with your order number and a photo, and we'll send a replacement or refund at no cost to

        <p>
          Once we receive and inspect your return, we'll process your refund to the original payment method.
          Depending on your bank or card issuer, it can take several business days for the refund to appear.

        <p>
          Return shipping is the customer's responsibility unless the return is due to our error (damaged, defective,
          or incorrect item).

        <p>
          Want a different scent instead? Follow the return process above for the original item and place a new
