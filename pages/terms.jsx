        These terms govern your use of veilpuff.com and any purchase you make from us. By using this site or placing
        an order, you agree to these terms.
      </p>

      <PolicySection title="Use of this site">
        <p>
          You may use this site to browse and purchase products for personal, non-commercial use. You agree not to
          misuse the site — including attempting to disrupt it, scrape it for commercial purposes, or use it for any

      <PolicySection title="Products and pricing">
        <p>
          We describe our products as accurately as we can, but product images are illustrative and may vary
          slightly from the item you receive. We reserve the right to correct pricing or description errors, limit
          order quantities, and discontinue products at any time without notice.
        </p>
      </PolicySection>

      <PolicySection title="Orders and payment">
        <p>
          Placing an order is an offer to purchase, which we may accept or decline (for example, if a product is out
          of stock or we suspect fraud). Payment is processed by Stripe or, if selected at checkout, QuickBooks
          Payments, at the time of purchase. You confirm that any payment details you provide are your own or
          that you're authorized to use them.
