# VEIL Full E-Commerce Site — Deployment Guide

This is a Next.js e-commerce site with a full product catalog, detailed product pages, shopping cart, and a custom checkout page that charges cards via QuickBooks Payments (no Shopify, no hosted redirect). Built entirely in VEIL's quiet-luxury aesthetic.

## What You Get

- **Homepage** with hero, featured products, brand story, and value proposition
- **Product catalog page** with all VEIL offerings
- **Individual product detail pages** with full descriptions, scent notes, and product specifications
- **Shopping cart** (persists across pages via localStorage, sticky sidebar)
- **Custom single-page checkout** (`/checkout`, styled after Shopify's checkout) — card number/expiry/CVC/name charged directly via QuickBooks Payments, with the billing address included in the same charge request so AVS/CVV verification runs at authorization time
- **Deployed to Vercel** (free, automatic scaling, HTTPS included)

## Step 1: Set Up QuickBooks Payments

1. Go to https://developer.intuit.com and sign in (or create an Intuit account).
2. Create a new app → **QuickBooks Online and Payments**.
3. On the app's **Payments** tab, enable QuickBooks Payments. This is tied to a merchant account — if you don't already have QuickBooks Payments active on your QuickBooks Online account, you'll need to complete Intuit's merchant underwriting first.
4. Under **Keys & OAuth**, grab the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** for the Sandbox environment (use Production once you're ready to take real charges). These go in `QB_CLIENT_ID` / `QB_CLIENT_SECRET`.
5. In that same **Keys & OAuth** section, add a redirect URI: `https://YOUR_DOMAIN/api/qb-auth/callback` (use your Vercel URL, or `http://localhost:3000/api/qb-auth/callback` for local testing).
6. After deploying and setting env vars (Step 2), visit `/api/qb-auth/connect` once to authorize.

### ⚠️ PCI compliance note

The checkout form sends card number/expiry/CVC directly to `/api/qb-checkout`, which charges it server-side (`lib/qbPaymentsServer.js`) rather than tokenizing it client-side first. This is deliberate: an earlier version of this integration tokenized the card in the browser and charged with just the resulting token, and real transactions came back with every verification field (AVS address, AVS zip, CVV) as `N/A` and got auto-voided by Intuit's risk engine — tokens are meant for saving a card for later/repeat use, and card network rules generally prevent re-verifying CVV through a stored token, so that flow never actually ran AVS/CVV checks against the network. Charging directly keeps the card and billing address in the same request that authorizes against the network. The tradeoff: raw card data now passes through this app's server for the duration of each charge request (never logged or stored), which generally puts the site in PCI DSS **SAQ D** scope rather than the lighter SAQ A. Confirm your actual compliance obligations with Intuit/your acquirer.

### ⚠️ Two non-obvious ways to get the Charges API to fail even with a valid OAuth connection

This exact integration hit an unresolved 403 on a previous attempt on this site. Both of the causes below were root-caused by direct testing against Intuit's sandbox and are easy to hit again — check both before assuming something else is wrong:

1. **Development vs. Production credentials must match `QB_ENVIRONMENT`.** Intuit issues a completely separate Client ID/Secret pair per environment (Keys & Credentials → Development / Production tabs), each with its own Redirect URIs list (Settings → Redirect URIs → Development / Production tabs). Using a Production Client ID while `QB_ENVIRONMENT=sandbox` (or vice versa) produces an access token whose environment doesn't match the API base URL it's sent to — Intuit's gateway rejects it with an **empty-body 403** before the request ever reaches real charge logic. Fix: make sure `QB_CLIENT_ID`/`QB_CLIENT_SECRET` come from the same Development/Production tab as `QB_ENVIRONMENT`, and that the matching redirect URI is registered under that same tab.
2. **Don't request `com.intuit.quickbooks.accounting` together with `com.intuit.quickbooks.payment`** in the same OAuth authorization. A combined-scope token consistently 401s (`AuthenticationFailed`) on the Payments Charges API even though it's otherwise valid — request `com.intuit.quickbooks.payment` alone (already how `pages/api/qb-auth/connect.js` is written).

If charges still fail after both of the above are correct, the remaining possibility is Intuit's separate Payments production-access approval (business verification / security questionnaire, found under the app's **Payments** tab if applicable). Test with a real sandbox charge (Step 4 below) before relying on this in production.

## Step 2: Deploy to Vercel

### Option A: Quick Deploy (Recommended)

1. Go to https://vercel.com and sign up (or log in with GitHub)
2. Click "New Project" → "Import Git Repository"
3. Select this repo
4. Click "Deploy"
5. After deployment, go to "Settings" → "Environment Variables"
6. Add:
   - `QB_CLIENT_ID` / `QB_CLIENT_SECRET`: from Step 1
   - `QB_ENVIRONMENT`: `sandbox` (or `production` once approved — see Step 1)
   - `KV_REST_API_URL` / `KV_REST_API_TOKEN`: from a KV store (Vercel Storage → Marketplace → Upstash, or a standalone Upstash Redis database — same REST API either way)
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL`: your Vercel domain (e.g., `https://veil-checkout.vercel.app`)
   - `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`: only needed if you still have orders placed via Stripe that you might need to refund
7. Redeploy by going to "Deployments" → last deployment → "Redeploy"
8. Visit `/api/qb-auth/connect` once to authorize (see Step 1)

### Option B: Deploy via Git

1. Push this folder to a GitHub repo
2. Connect that repo to Vercel
3. Add environment variables (same as above)
4. Vercel auto-deploys every push

---

## Step 3: Connect Your Domain (Squarespace)

1. In Vercel, go to "Settings" → "Domains"
2. Click "Add Domain"
3. Enter the domain you want (e.g., `checkout.veilpuff.com`)
4. Vercel will show you nameservers or CNAME record to add
5. In Squarespace:
   - Go to Settings → Domains
   - Find your domain settings
   - Add the Vercel DNS records
   - Wait ~24 hours for DNS to propagate
6. Once DNS is live, Vercel will auto-generate an SSL certificate

---

## Step 4: Test the Checkout

1. Go to your deployed domain
2. Add a product to the cart and click "Checkout"
3. Fill in the contact/shipping fields, then the card fields with one of Intuit's [sandbox test cards](https://developer.intuit.com/app/developer/qbpayments/docs/develop/sandboxes/payments-test-cards) — real card numbers don't work against the sandbox environment
4. Submit and check your QuickBooks Payments dashboard — the charge should appear
5. This is the integration that hit an unresolved 403 previously (see Step 1) — if it fails, work through that section's two gotchas before assuming something else is broken

---

## Customizing Products

All products live in `lib/products.js`.

To change them:
1. Edit `lib/products.js`
2. Update product names, prices, images, descriptions, scent notes
3. Push to GitHub (or redeploy to Vercel)
4. Changes go live automatically

## Site Structure

### Pages
- `/` — Homepage with hero, featured products, brand story
- `/shop` — Full product catalog
- `/product/[id]` — Individual product detail pages
- `/checkout` — Custom single-page checkout
- `/success` — Order confirmation page

### Components
- `Header.jsx` — Navigation, cart button, logo
- `CartDrawer.jsx` — Slide-in cart, links to `/checkout`
- Product data at `lib/products.js`

### Architecture
- **Frontend**: Next.js React app (all pages)
- **Cart state**: React Context (`lib/useCart.js`), persisted to `localStorage` so it survives navigation to `/checkout`
- **Backend**: Vercel serverless function at `/api/qb-checkout` (charges the card directly via QuickBooks Payments and fulfills the order, no webhook needed since there's no off-site redirect step) plus `/api/qb-auth/connect` + `/api/qb-auth/callback` (one-time QuickBooks OAuth authorization)
- **Payments**: card details are sent from `/checkout` to `/api/qb-checkout`, which charges them directly against the QuickBooks Payments Charges API (`lib/qbPaymentsServer.js`) — see the PCI note in Step 1
- **QuickBooks token refresh**: `lib/qbServerAuth.js` transparently refreshes the QuickBooks access token using a refresh token persisted in the KV store (`lib/qbTokenStore.js`) before every charge — no manual token rotation
- **Hosting**: Vercel (free tier handles all traffic)

---

## Security Notes

- `QB_CLIENT_SECRET`, `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, and the KV-stored QuickBooks tokens live only in Vercel's environment variables / KV store (never in code)
- Card details submitted on `/checkout` are sent over HTTPS to `/api/qb-checkout`, forwarded directly to QuickBooks Payments, and never logged or persisted anywhere in this app — but they do pass through this app's server (see the PCI note in Step 1)
- HTTPS is automatic (Vercel provides free SSL)

---

## Troubleshooting

**"QuickBooks Payments is not connected yet" error:**
- Visit `/api/qb-auth/connect` once to authorize (see Step 1) — this only needs to happen once per environment (sandbox/production each need their own authorization)

**QuickBooks charge fails with an empty-body 403, or a 401 "AuthenticationFailed":**
- See the two gotchas under Step 1 — a Development/Production credential mismatch with `QB_ENVIRONMENT`, and requesting the accounting scope alongside the payment scope, are both far more common causes than an actual account/approval problem

**"KV_REST_API_URL / KV_REST_API_TOKEN are not set" error:**
- Provision a KV store (Vercel Storage → Marketplace → Upstash, or a standalone Upstash Redis database) and add its REST URL/token to your environment variables

**Domain not connecting:**
- DNS can take 24–48 hours to propagate
- Check Vercel's domain status (should show green ✓)

## About the Bankful integration

A Bankful checkout integration also exists in the codebase (`lib/bankfulServer.js`), left over from a prior attempt to switch processors. It's not currently wired up to `/checkout` — it returned a **"merchant not configured, please contact Gateway"** error from Bankful's own API, which needs to be resolved with Bankful support (likely either a sandbox/live host mismatch, or the merchant account not being enabled for direct card charges) before it can be tried again. The admin Orders tab has a `bankful` refund branch ready to go if that integration is ever revived.

---

## Next Steps

1. Deploy this to Vercel
2. Provision a KV store and add `QB_CLIENT_ID` / `QB_CLIENT_SECRET` / `QB_ENVIRONMENT` / `KV_REST_API_URL` / `KV_REST_API_TOKEN` (sandbox QuickBooks keys to start — see Step 1)
3. Visit `/api/qb-auth/connect` once to authorize
4. Test a full checkout with a QuickBooks sandbox card, and confirm the Merchant Center transaction shows real AVS/CVV match results (not `N/A`)
5. When ready for real charges, swap to the Production Client ID/Secret + redirect URI and switch `QB_ENVIRONMENT` to `production`
6. Connect your domain
