// Every paid order is reported to Meta as a server-side Purchase, and the
// outcome is kept on the order itself (order.meta) so nothing is lost
// silently: lib/orderFulfillment.js sends it at checkout, and
// pages/api/meta/resend-purchases.js (hourly cron) retries any order Meta
// didn't accept.
//
// Deduplication: the event_id is the same one the browser Pixel's Purchase
// on /success used, so Meta counts a pixel+server pair once; an order with
// no browser event id gets a stable `order_<id>` instead. A retry only ever
// resends an order whose earlier send was never accepted, and always with
// the same event_id, so it can't add a second Purchase for the same order.
//
// action_source is "website" for every order placed since order.meta was
// added — they're website orders, and that's what lets Meta dedupe them
// against the Pixel. The one exception is admin's per-order "Send to Meta"
// button (pages/api/admin/orders/meta.js) on older orders saved without
// the shopper's user agent or page URL: Meta requires both for website
// events and may discard events missing them, so those go as "other"
// instead, still matched to the buyer by hashed email/phone (and the ad
// click id, where the order recorded one).
