// What we know about the person browsing, for ad-match quality.
//
// Meta scores an event on how many identifiers it carries. Until now the
// browser Pixel sent none at all (see lib/fbPixel.js — `fbq('init')` was
// called with no Advanced Matching object), and the server-side CAPI events
// carried email/phone only on Purchase. So every AddToCart, InitiateCheckout
// and PageView went out effectively anonymous, which is what Events Manager
// keeps flagging.
//
// This is the single place that remembers a shopper's email and phone once
// they've typed them, so every later event on this device can carry them.
//
// Scope and privacy:
//   - Stored in localStorage on the shopper's own device — their own contact
//     details, which they entered themselves, not data about anyone else.
//   - Cleared by clearIdentity() so a shared device can be reset.
//   - Values are kept in plain form here because Meta's Pixel hashes
//     Advanced Matching client-side before it sends anything, and the server
//     hashes with SHA-256 before it sends anything (lib/metaCapi.js). The
//     plain value never leaves the device.
